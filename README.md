# PhysLesson
 
This project is part of a physics lesson at school.
To develop this project, I was encouraged by the students' interest in this topic.
In this project, the movement of a body thrown at an angle to the horizon is modeled.
The Unity engine was chosen because it has a good physics of objects.
This project is adapted for Pico VR (virtual reality glasses (Android)), control is carried out using a joystick.
In the project is implemented one scene, with the ability to conduct three experiments by pressing the buttons. The experiments are accompanied by pictures and formulas. There is also a demo video that briefly tells about this topic in physics.

You can watch a demo video about the gameplay here:
